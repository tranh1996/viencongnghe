# NPM Install Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved

The npm install was failing due to a peer dependency conflict between `react-helmet-async` and React 19.

### Error Details:
```
npm error ERESOLVE could not resolve
npm error peer react@"^16.6.0 || ^17.0.0 || ^18.0.0" from react-helmet-async@2.0.5
npm error Found: react@19.1.1
```

## Solution Applied

### 1. Used Legacy Peer Dependencies
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

This flag allows npm to install packages with peer dependency conflicts by using the legacy resolution algorithm.

### 2. Created .npmrc Configuration
Created `.npmrc` file with:
```
legacy-peer-deps=true
```

This ensures that future npm installs will automatically use the legacy peer deps resolution.

## Verification

### ✅ Installation Successful
- All dependencies installed correctly
- No more peer dependency conflicts

### ✅ Build Successful
- Production build completed without errors
- Only ESLint warnings (non-blocking)

### ✅ Development Server Running
- Server started successfully on port 3000
- Application accessible at http://localhost:3000

### ✅ Sitemap Generation Working
- Sitemap generation script runs successfully
- All SEO files generated correctly

## Why This Works

The `react-helmet-async` package hasn't been updated to officially support React 19 yet, but it works perfectly fine with React 19 in practice. The `--legacy-peer-deps` flag allows us to bypass the strict peer dependency checking while maintaining full functionality.

## Future Considerations

1. **Monitor Updates**: Keep an eye on `react-helmet-async` updates for official React 19 support
2. **Alternative**: Consider switching to `react-helmet` or other alternatives if needed in the future
3. **Testing**: The current setup works perfectly for production use

## Files Modified

- `.npmrc` - Added legacy peer deps configuration
- `package.json` - Dependencies already correctly configured

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED

The npm install issue has been completely resolved and all functionality is working correctly.
